# 🧠 Word Trainer App
A clean and efficient Kotlin-based Android application designed to help users expand their vocabulary by guessing the correct translation of words.

---

## 🚀 Overview
Word Trainer is a lightweight and structured learning tool built for people who want to improve their language skills. The user sees a word in English and must choose or guess the correct translation into another language.

This project focuses on clean logic, simplicity, and extendability — making it easy to scale with more languages, word packs, or game modes.

## ✨ Features
- 🔤 Random word generation
- 🔁 Multiple attempts & retries
- 📚 Word model structure for easy expansion
- ⚡ Fast and responsive Kotlin-based architecture
- 🎯 Simple UI focused on learning, not distraction

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Architecture:** Clean logic / MVVM (optional based on your setup)
- **UI:** Android XML (or Jetpack Compose if added)
- **Data:** Local word lists or remote source (future-ready)
